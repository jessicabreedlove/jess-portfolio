                I started learning to code years ago when I stopped working to stay home with my first baby.
                Although I didn't see how it would apply to my future then, I really enjoyed it!
                I found that as I did the Codecademy courses for HTML and CSS that coding was creative and fun!
                It got me thinking about getting into the Tech industry and becoming a programmer.
