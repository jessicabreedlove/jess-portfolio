                Hi, I'm Jessica Reece. I'm a Mother of two, and pursuing a career in Software Developement.
                Iâ€™m passionate about learning and I am willing to take risks and go after what I want in life.
                I'm eager to get my degree and work in the Computer Science field. <br>
                My goals include being a present mother and equal partner to my husband.
                I also want to gain new experience and skills and make my time more valuable.
                I want to inspire others, especially women, to see the power in their own lives,
                to pursue their goals, and to have a healthier life. I want my work to change the world.
                Whether I make a new discovery or just a new connection, I know I can make a difference.
